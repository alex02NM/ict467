</i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify">Hello welcome to the podcast of Webgl Learn there are many technologies out there when it comes to programming how technology is rapidly changing based on AI but what does it mean AI, AI is very mainstream and can mean so many things, and with modern social media everyone like to hype technology and could be a main trend for a month and everyone dies out but AI has been around for around since 1950 by alan turning and when it comes to AI it’s all just math and all for some kind of statistics. AI also doesn’t need to be very advanced and as a programmer, I didn’t even know I was programming an AI. I once had to create a color detection and used the algorithm mean clustering and all it does is grab the closest pixels and create a set of color pellets. also, even in video games in the past like Space Invaders, the Enemies were considered AI. But over the years AI has become more advanced from 3d video games following a path trying to kill you and even figuring out when it should shoot its weapons toward you and AI has improved creating machine learning learning over time.</p>
